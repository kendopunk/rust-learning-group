# Session 4 Homework

## 1) Fix main.rs in session4

1. Remove the block comments from the words `UNCOMMENT HERE...` to the words `...TO HERE` in multiple places...
1. ...or pull out blocks of code individually outside the comments and work on them one at a time.
1. Look for // @TODO comments for code you need to write / provide
1. Run `$> cargo run --bin session4` and reviewing the errors and warnings
1. This homework also gives a gentle introduction to Rust's module system...pretty easy to figure out, but it can get complicated later
1. If you run into some module issues, make sure your module methods are `pub` (public) where they need to be.
1. Happy Rusting
